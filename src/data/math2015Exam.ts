      question: "What is the value of x that satisfies the equation 5((125/8)^(1/3))^(x^2 - (2/3)x) = 2?",
      options: [
        "1",

      ],
      correctAnswerIndex: 1,
      explanation: "Notice (125/8)^(1/3) = (5^3 / 2^3)^(1/3) = 5/2. The equation is 5 * (5/2)^(x^2 - (2/3)x) = 2 => (5/2)^(x^2 - (2/3)x) = 2/5 = (5/2)^(-1). Thus x^2 - (2/3)x = -1 => 3x^2 - 2x + 3 = 0, or solving with the roots gives x = -3/2."

      options: [
        "If f(a) = 0, then x - a is a factor for f(x).",
        "If f(a) = 0, then (x - a)² is a factor for f(x).",
        "If f(a) = 0, then a is not necessarily in the domain.",
        "If f(a) = 0, then y = a is the y-intercept."

      explanation: "By the Factor Theorem for polynomials and functions, if f(a) = 0, then (x - a) is a linear factor of f(x)."
